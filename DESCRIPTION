Description: Power analysis using Monte Carlo simulation is flexible and
    compatible with a large class of statistical models, especially when
    closed-formed power equations aren't available. This package allows users
    to conduct power analysis using simulation in settings in which consideration
    of the correlations between predictors is important. Users can set up
    a data generative model that preserves dependence structures among
    variables given existing data (continuous, binary, or ordinal). Users can
    also generate power curves to assess the trade-offs between sample size,
    effect size, and power of a design.
