Description: A flexible framework for power analysis using Monte
    Carlo simulation for settings in which considerations of the correlations
    between predictors are important. Users can set up a data generative model
    that preserves dependence structures among predictors given existing data
    (continuous, binary, or ordinal). Users can also generate power curves to
    assess the trade-offs between sample size, effect size, and power of a design.
    This package includes several statistical models common in environmental
    mixtures studies. For more details and tutorials, see Nguyen et al. (2022) <doi:...TODO>.
